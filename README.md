# balancing-builder-bot
A self-balancing, two-wheeled robot developed for the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (IIT Bombay). Built using only an Arduino Nano, MPU6050, and 300 RPM N20 motors, the bot maintains balance via real-time IMU data and PID control â€” all while performing complex tasks like moving in all directions, picking and transporting objects.
